### What's the main goal of this program?
This program makes statistics from the lottery draws made on the given date (namely Putto).
### How does it work?
The user selects the date from the datepicker, presses the button, it'll send a request to the site, scrapes the useable data, then creates statistics from the data.
### Issues
- static cookie (may not work next week)
- bar shows up on seperate window
